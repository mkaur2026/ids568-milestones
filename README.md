## Documentation

1. Environment reproducibility supports ML lifecycle reliability by using a python virtual environment and pinning the versions in 'requirements.txt', which ensures anyone who clones the repository can recreate the same results and environment. 

2. The key reproducibility principles that were applied in my setup were dependency pinning, clear project structure, virtual environment, and a smoke test using pytest. The GitHub workflow runs in a great environment for each push, that verifies that all of the dependencies are correctly installed and working.

3. Environment management supports deployment success by making sure the code runs withou any errors due to differences, it also makes deployment faster and more predictable by catching problems early.
